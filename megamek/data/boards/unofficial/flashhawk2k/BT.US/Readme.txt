Hy Mechwarriors,
while browsing the net i found Battletech.us quite some time ago and was thrilled by the Terrain that Mike Stanfill presents there. Never ever 
am i  going to play on these. Unless i would do them as MM-Boards..:D So i did. Ok, not all. Everything the involves 3D-structures is either 
impossible to MM or to complex for me, so i skipped that. What i did was i tried to copy the boards that he showed on his Website. That wasn't 
totally possible because of the quality of the pics. So i tried to take these pics more as an inspiration than a template. So, have fun whit 
these, and whenever the programing crew is getting to it, figure 8 will be enhanced by deployment zones directly into the map. Oh, and when 
somebody can give me a better solution for the bottomless pits of the tower map, please do so :)
