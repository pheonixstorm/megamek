1.2  Added Fluff, fixed some exit bugs and some building problems

1.1  Put Real buildings in place of elevated pavement, some small cosmetic changes to things all around, still
     no bridges

1.0
Included here are 25 custom maps I built using the Map Editor for MegaMek.
  I made these for my friends for those massive battles, so we do not have to pick
 random 3x3 and hope we do not have to deploy in water or cruddy terrain, surrounded by more water.

The general layout as 4 bases in each corner of the 5X5 map set, 1 and 2 are the upper left and right,
 and 3 and 4 are the lower left and right.  A city and park used to lay to the east, but many battles
 and attpts to rebuild have left it a abandoned slum where the park has overgrown and the skyscrapers
 still stand on the edge of what used to be downtown, now parts of it are housing projects and small
 industrial sites.  To the west we have a river crossing some 9 maps in its path and ending in
 a large lake.  To the south lay some craggy terrain and the start of a mountain range.  In the center
 lays a great hill, the tallest point on the map other then the downtown citys, many a battle has been
 fought over it and the mount has seen many mechwarriors fall to their doom, a bit to the southeast is
 another mound carved in to a defensive position but has fallen into dis-use, but still usefull for
 hiding troops and some mechs can jump up the walls, fire and jump down before the enemy knew what hit
 them.

But the whole point is that this set was to be used by my group as a multipurpose map, has water,
 forests, hills, bases, a city, and ALL the road/river connect points work with all BT maps, exept
 some ones where the road AND water have to cross maps on the same hexes, but try it anyway.  I got
 it to work out.  The river and road system are mostly modular and can be used to make new terrain
 sets.  These maps where made with Double Blind in mind.

To use these in the set they wher built to be first make the "Map Size(boards)  ___ X ___" to 5 X 5.
  Megamek sees the 1st board as #0 so the ## should look like this


         0  1  2  3  4

         5  6  7  8  9

         10 11 12 13 14

         15 16 17 18 19

         20 21 22 23 24

Start with map#00, or Base#1.  The "M##xx" is the map # that map is supposed to be in, so M##19 would
 be spot 19 on the map selector.  Here is the list of maps with a short discription of them.

1.   M#00: Base #1.  All base maps are just concrete with walls around them, each one faces outward to the center, a
           small bunker like thing rests in the back, use this spot for like a flag in capture the flag or whatever.

2.   M#01: Rollong Road 2. a rolling hills map with road #2.

3.   M#02: BR2 River. River goes from Right to Bottom, #2 (different map then BR#1, you need both)

4.   M#03: LB River. river from Left to Bottom

5.   M#04: Base #2.

6.   M#05: Light Woods R1. light woods near base #1

7.   M#06: BRRiver. Bottom to Right river #1

8.   M#07: River Xing.  River Crossings

9.   M#08: Ruin River. decrepit side of town, seen 1 to many battles, never repaired 

10.  M#09: Ghetto. next to ruin Riverside, not as bad tho, buildings are mid-high projects from after the battles,
           some alleyways, thanks to Nate for the ghetto idea.

11.  M#10: Picket Lake. Put a picket force here, road, trees, lake, pit-stop/rally point of concrete.

12.  M#11: Big Fricken Lake. A Big Fricken Lake, but jumpable if you try for the island

13.  M#12: KOTH. King Of The Hill,  Take this hill and become king and see all the battlefield, usefull for any King
           Of The Hill game, all important scout point, a nice cliff face to push someone off of, etc.

14.  M#13: Forest Road. Forest + Road, some small conctere pit-stops for when the forest goes to blazes

15.  M#14: Grey City.  Buildings work, need custom firemoth with 10 JJ to get ontop of some the REALLY tall ones,
           or combat drop troops ontop, but where will they go from their?

16.  M#15: Rolling Road #1. rolling hills with road, #1

17.  M#16: Castle GreySkull. Well their is no skull, one of the best defensive positions on the map and one of the
           best place to be... and sometimes not.  Even got a moat and (non)working bridge and a nice view of the lake,
           city and KOTH hill, stash atrillery here, when it is programed in

18.  M#17: Crag Road. hide in here, rocks, roads, just do not fall off or be ambushed

19.  M#18: Xing. road Xing, with stuff 

20.  M#19: Induspark. industrial park area next to new growth forests 

21.  M#20: Base #3 

22.  M#21: Picket Mount. a place to put a picket force, next to a mountain 

23.  M#22: Crag Maze. THIS is why JJ where invented, not impassable, but hard if you do not look carefully, or if you
           look at it another way, your perfect flanking route with mobile meds and lights that you want to keep out of
           LOS.

24.  M#23: FINAL MAP. last map I made, ran out of names (a while ago), has stuff 

25.  M#24: Base #4. the REAL last map
