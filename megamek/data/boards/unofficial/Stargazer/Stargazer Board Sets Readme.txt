Hi Mechwarriors,
this is the complete compilation (to date) of all Mapsets designed by Eric
"Stargazer" Alexopoulos, who also owns the copyrights. There are nine
mapsets with five mapsheets each, which will give you many options to play.
The mapsets include everything from hills to canyons, and swamps to cities.
Contact Eric at greyeagl@nycap.rr.com for more information on printed
versions of these mapsheets.
